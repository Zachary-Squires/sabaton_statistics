# sabaton_statistics

Repository to hold things related to my Sabaton/Spotify statisical analysis project, in which I used Spotify's API and a python program I wrote in a Jupyter Notebook to get data regarding all of Sabaton's songs and enter the data into a SQL database. I then used that information to build a tableau dashboard in order to visualize Sabaton's musical journey over the years. 

Although my Jupyter Notebook is included, it will not function given that my client secret isn't included to prevent abuse of Spotify's API. If someone wanted to recreate my project they would need to go to Spotify's developer (https://developer.spotify.com/) and register their own app and plug their own client ID and secret into the program. Also included is the sabaton table from my MySQL database in CSV form.
